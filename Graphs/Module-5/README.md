This Module consists of the following:

1. Prim's algorithm
2. Kruskal's algorithm
3. Our algorithm: Out algorithm finds the MST by the following approach: 
			Sorts all edges, deletes Max weighted edge, checks if the graph is disconnected, if yes, then puts back the edge, else 				moves onto next edge until number of edges = number of vertices - 1.

Run 'make all' to run the programs.
